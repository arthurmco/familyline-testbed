# Contributing

First of all, thank you for taking your time to help me. Honestly, I
*really* appreciate that.

We don't have a code of conduct, because I think everybody can be a
nice person. In doubt, think the developers and contributors of this
software are 2m (approx 6'7" for the imperial system people) black
belt fighters with a Theo de Raadt-like patience and humor.

But, honestly, I want you to feel confortable here. If you're not,
send-me an email. The address is on my github profile

## How do I start?

You can start solving issues.

If you want to do something new, you can open an issue and discuss. I
usually write some things I am planning in a long term in the `docs`
folder, and open issues with the `feature-planning` label for
short-term thoughts.
