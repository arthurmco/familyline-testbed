 *   - the inputs; each input is marked by the FINP keyword. We mark the inputs
 *     because, in the case of an unexpected crash, we can use this file for
 *     debugging; the file will be incomplete, but we can find the input commands
 *     thanks to those keywords.
 *   - the footer, marked by the FEND keyword, contains 4 bytes of keyword, 4 bytes of
 *     input data count and 4 bytes of checksum
 *
 * We do not store the size of the whole file, because this is more like of a streaming
 * format; it is made to be recoverable and readable even if it is a little bit corrupted,
