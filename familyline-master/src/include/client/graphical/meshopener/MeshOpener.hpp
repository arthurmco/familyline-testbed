/**
 * Familyline mesh opener class
 *
 * The mesh opener "Open" method returns a list of meshes, because a mesh file
 * can have more than one mesh
 *
 * Before, you could use the mesh directly from the file opener.
 * You still can (using mesh_list[0]), but it's not recommended.
 *
 * It's recommended to use the MeshManager and its Get method, or the
 * AssetManager, using the path (asset_name/mesh_name)
 *
 * The mesh name is defined in the file itself. The definition of "mesh" can vary from file to
 * file.
 * For example, inside .obj files, it is the mesh group
