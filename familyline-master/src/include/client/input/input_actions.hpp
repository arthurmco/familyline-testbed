/**
 * Part of the implementation for the build action
 *
 * An input action is basically a sum type of all the actions you
 * can do in game
 *
 * We have two:
 *  - the human input action, for things that only humans (read: the one
 *    that can click on the menus) can do, like click, move the mouse
 *  - the player input action, for things that all players can do, like
 *    request objects to be build, and position the camera.
