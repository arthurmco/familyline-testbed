#+TITLE: Attack manager

  The attack manager calculations are somewhat complex, so it needs to be
  somewhat decently documented, and this is what I want to do here.

  Note that what is in here is what is written right now, future discussions
  about the attack manager, like projectiles or critical damage, will not be
  documented until their implementation starts.

* Behavior

  Only melee attacks are implemented, although projectile attacks will be soon.

  No matter what attacks are implemented, they have an angle of attack.

  For melee, they can have a minimum and maximum melee distance.

  #+ATTR_HTML: :alt A circle representing the minimum distance, other representing the maximum distance, and a "pie slice" representing the attack area. The dot in the center is the player
  [[file:attack-angle.png]]
   
  In the figure, the angle of attack is represented by the red
  polygon's arc, the maximum melee distance is the black circle and the
  minimum is the magenta circle; the blue dot is the entity.

  The only area where the defending unit will take damage is the area inside
  the red polygon.

** Melee

   The melee attack is, currently, the only one implemented.

   We have some default behaviors for it

*** Attack Points (AP):
    On each *attack oportunity*, the HP of the attacked unit will be ==HP -
    (APa - DPd)==, where =HP= is the attacked unit health points, =APa= is the
    attacker's attack points, and =DPd= is the attacked unit defense points.

*** Defense Points (DP):
    When an *attack* is done, the defense points says how much we absorve the
    attacker's damage

*** Attack Speed (AS):
    Determines the *attack opportunity*.

    We calculate a *number* =n=. This number is 2048 divided by your *attack
    speed*.

    Then, you starts counting down: each tick you decrement this number by one
    until it reaches zero. When it reaches zero, an *attack opportunity*
    happens, and you do damage.

    Then, we reset this number to =2048/AS= again.

    If this number is between zero and 1, we attack and add =2048/AS= to this
    number, until it reaches one. Then you decrement it as usual.

    =n= cannot be less than 1/128, and your attack speed cannot be negative.

*** Precision
    When you attack, a random number between 0 and 100 is created. If the number
    is below or equal the precision value, the attacked unit gets *damaged*.

    Note that the precision only can go between 0 and 100.

*** Distance
    The maximum distance that you can attack, It is the radius of that black
    circle in the image above, in game units.

    FOr melee units, this value is usually small, usually 3x the side of the
    entity bounding box

*** Maximum angle
    The maximum angle of attack, in radians
    
    
** Projectile
   Projectile attacks are not implemented
