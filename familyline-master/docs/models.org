#+TITLE: Model contribution

Familyline supports, for now, two types of model formats: Wavefront
OBJ and MD2, without animation

It will support animated MD2, MD3, MD4, FBX and Collada
	  
Please note that the 'model unit 1' is equal to 1 meter, and the
camera is +24m high, so take note of the size of your model to it not
appear so big on Familyline than you expected (most md2 models I saw
are ~40m high). For comparison, the default cube on Blender, and
probably on other modeling software, is 1m^3

But there are some guidelines you'll have to follow if you want
Familyline to correctly load your model. They are made specifically
for Blender3D, 'cause it is what I use, but you can adapt it for other
modelling software if you're smart.

* OBJ

- To export for OBJ format, the Forward direction needs to be -Z and
  the Up direction needs to be Y
  (Forward: -Z forward and Up: Y up)

- "Triangulate Faces" *must* be selected, otherwise the engine won't
  load your model correctly.

- The "Write Materials" option can be let checked, it will add an mtl
  file there. However, the usage of this option will be discouraged in the future.

- OBJ animations are not supported and never will be.

- 1 mesh per file. There's support for more in the parser, but not in
  the mesh opener nor in the asset.

- The other defaults are OK.
 
* MD2

- Before exporting, please rotate the model so the Y axis (the green
  arrow) points to the model up direction, and the Z direction (the
  blue arrow) points to the back of your model.

- You need to specify the texture in the code. Familyline doesn't
  support texture loading from MD2 and MD2 format doesn't specify
  material names. But the UV coordinates are read correcly.

- MD2 animations are supported.

- The defaults are OK.
